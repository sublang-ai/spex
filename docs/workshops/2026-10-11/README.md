# Workshop simulation 2026-10-11

Ten fictional teams went through Day 2 (one procedure per SDLC stage, shared across teams through the registry) and Day 3 (a project each, cross-team reuse) on the Spex stack, each driven by an agent playing its representative, with the organizer on her own Spex home.
The aim was to find what stops a real team or makes the app hard to use, and to fix what mattered.

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| [plan.md](plan.md) | the teams, their procedures, their projects, the reuse map and how the simulation ran |
| [issues.md](issues.md) | every finding, most severe first, with its state (fixed, being fixed, open, not ours) |
| [T01.md](T01.md) … [T10.md](T10.md) | one page per team: what happened, what they found |

## What was fixed during the simulation

| Finding | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| W-01 subgroups invisible; W-02 no groups or sharing without GitLab.com; W-15 Chinese group names refused; W-03 second-device conflict over the seeded environment | spex-pub DR-021 (groups at every depth, `can` flags, GitLab's roles, members, optional `path`) and Spex DR-114 (New group, New subgroup, Members, Share, Remove, Path field, second-device join) — spex PR 103, spex-pub PRs 5 and 6 (all merged; spex-pub deployed to the internal instance) |
| W-07 built-ins read as not enabled; W-09 Chinese project gets an English package; W-11/W-12 compile failures a preamble hint prevents | spex PR 104 (merged) |
| W-22 a recovered session wears the failure tone forever | spex PR 105 (merged) |
| W-14 created group not listed until a refresh | spex PR 106 (merged) |
| W-17 untracked package blocks `/pr`; W-18 org defaults to an unclaimable login; W-19 compiler cache in releases; W-21 missing license refused by the registry | spex PR 107 (merged) |

## What is still open

- Playbook runtime: W-23 (a judge's output shape fails a completed step and the closing reply misreports it), W-25 (a step's repository effect is fixed at link time: work already committed, or two commits, fail the run), W-10 (uncommitted drafts cannot link).
- slc: W-11 (English markers inside Chinese sources), W-12 (two-word roles fail late).
- Spex: W-26 (a spec-kind package reaches no agent), W-08 (built-in playbooks in English only), W-13, W-20, W-24, W-04, W-05, W-06 (minor).

## By the numbers

Filled at the end of the simulation: see the per-team pages for commits, review rounds and agent active time.
